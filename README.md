⠀⠀PLEASE KNOW THAT:

- ALTERS RUN FREELY
 
- Skins that are vibrant or have a consistency usage of vibrant colors are ponies are made via emotions made to express them, if the main colors (e.g red highlights) inconsistent, consider it overwhelmed or had an episode.

- Please be patient with me, i sometimes have a hard time deciphering tone.
